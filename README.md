Calculate the funds you will need to deposit to stay afloat due to T212s CFD leverage change from 1:2 -> 1:5

On Wednesday the 25th of November, trading broker 'Trading212' announced they would change the leverage on the CFD platform from 1:2 to 1:5 at 15:30 GMT on Thursday the 26th. In essence, this meant that previously customers had to have 20% of the position in cash as a kind of deposit while T212 fronted the remaining 80% (offering the customer 1:5 leverage). Suddenly users had to have 50% of the position in cash while T212 covers the remaining 50%. The announcement initially gave users under a day to ensure their accounts were funded with the extra money to maintain their positions. Should their accounts not have been funded, they would get margin called and trading positions would be closed, costing users a lot of cash. 

Eventually, T212 postponed the leverage change until Tuesday the 1st of December at market open, 14:30 GMT. 

This calculator was made to help users understand exactly how much money they need to upload to their account, to remain at a margin level of their choosing.
